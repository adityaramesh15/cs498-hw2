Latency Analysis: 
The difference between the two regions is largely due to geographic and physical network constraints from my location. 
It is clear that the US endpoint consistently outperformed the European one because my cleint script was running locally in the US. 
What was also interesting is that I could see the latency decrease as the servers warmed up and the data was brought to memory instead of disk.
That was evident in the fact that the higher-count queries were still quicker, only because they were run after the initial queries.
A short 10-run test was done last to demonstarte the differences between cold and warm servers.

Consistency Analysis
While I did expect there to be some inconsistent behavior, I was not able to record this occuring. I believe it to be a result of my network
speed being slower than google's fiber connection, as there mightve been a large amount of time between when I posted and then did a get from 
europe that was simply longer than google updating consistency of the Firestore DB across its nodes and it being accessed by the european compute instance. 
I trie to use asynchrnous code as well to alleviate any slow behavior due to serial porgramming as well, but I had no luck in that regard either. I could
see thsi going faster and catching the inconsistent behavior only if I was running the benchmark on a european VM itself as well.
