Latency Analysis: 
The difference between the two regions is largely due to geographic and physical network constraints from my location. 
It is clear that the US endpoint consistently outperformed the European one because my cleint script was running locally in the US. 
What was also interesting is that I could see the latency decrease as the servers warmed up and the data was brought to memory instead of disk.
That was evident in the fact that the higher-count queries were still quicker, only because they were run after the initial queries.
A short 10-run test was done last to demonstarte the differences between cold and warm servers.
